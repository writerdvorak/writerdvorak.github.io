<p>The layout focuses on not changing symbol locations when on the same hand.
 This cuts down on confusion when switching between Qwerty and Dvorak.
 For example []=/-z are in the same locations as Qwerty unlike Dvorak.
 If you look at the <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:KB_DSKtypewriter.svg">classic Dvorak</a> 
 location the number keys were out of order a natural progression is to put as many
 symbols back to the original locations.  As someone who writes text these keys made my life a headache.  
 It is called Writer Dvorak because it focuses on writing English in Dvorak.
 I do some programming with Unix and JavaScript(CSS & HTML) but the English
 language was the target.  I finally decided that if a key isn't on, below or above
 the home row it shouldn't be changed but the keyboard layout became to different to
 Dvorak so I scratched this with the semicolon.  Programmer Dvorak changes a lot more keys especially 
 when it comes to the number keys.
 <!--h4>Why didn't you put " in the same location?</h4>
 Because I type on Dvorak frequently enough that my head got to confused
 and the location of the ; is close enough to Qwerty with a finger switch.
 When I switched to Dvorak on work and other computers I primarily needed the 
 English language and that is it. -->
 <h4>Why was the i moved?</h4>
 I was moved because it has a higher frequency in the English language.
 If you don't like it move it.  My head tends to switch back and forth
 between regular Dvorak and this modification okay.  I(7.31%) is higher then U(2.88%).
 <h4>Why are there 2 f keys?</h4>
 Because F keys(2.3%), the symbols and the I(7.31%) keys should fall in line with
 <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kdeloach/workman/gh-pages/images/keyboard_graded1.png">difficulty to reach</a> and the fact 90% of people are right handed. 
 In Dvorak the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_frequency#/media/File:English_letter_frequency_(frequency).svg">letter frequency</a> in the graph below.  X has a .17% frequency so it selected based 
 on similarity of the F key.  If you type on F frequently on a laptop and computer 
 it makes reaching the key that much easier on a laptop with out having to reach for the keys.  
 X is reached by pressing ctrl+alt+bottom F or AltGr+bottom f depending on the layout.  F is roughly 13 times more common as X.
 Dvorak was designed originally for a staggered keyboard and not a flat laptop.
</p>
<h4>Is English the only target language?</h4>
<p>Yes at this time it is.  Dead keys could be added easily but I simply don't use them at all in English.  Bash which makes extensive use of the -_ keys has an AltGr switch to be the same as Dvorak.</p>
